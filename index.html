It was years later when i finally realized what capabilities i possess and i would give a great debt to my Mother as she spoted the talent for tech in me at a young age. I did enroll for a <b>Civil Engineering</b> in 2019 but i had to learn the hard way that buliding was not my fortee.

							<h2>Hobbies & Talents</h2>
							<p>I am a detail-driven ICT and Computer Science graduate with a passion for turning technical complexity into clear, practical solutions. I specialize in breaking down concepts into step-by-step guides, visual diagrams, and real-world examples that make learning and execution seamless.</p>
							<p>My strengths include technical drawing (especially isometric and orthographic projections), CSS styling, image editing, and documentation refinement. I am resourceful in adapting to software and hardware limitations, always finding creative workarounds to maintain clarity and compliance.</p>
							<p>I thrive on building toolkits—formulas, templates, and branded layouts—that elevate both academic and professional work. With a growth mindset and a collaborative spirit, I approach every challenge with humility, precision, and a drive to improve.</p>
